watched icon working on award races page?

way to import team and player info
- options
  - like before, from manage teams
  - when creating a new league, option to use teams from another file
  - somehow globally specify default teams

what would it really cost to store all game sim results?

playoff upsets

show spread, ovr, etc on live game sim game selection page

way to disable saving? @champ1432#2175
- changes

add triggered events
- team info (name, region, abbrev, cid, did, etc.)
- expansion
- gameAttributes changes (salary cap, tendencies, etc)
  - finances ones make sense as triggered events, or should it be defined as some % growth?
- {season: number, phase: number, type: string, action: any}
- new object store or g.triggeredEvents

league structure changes, without breaking history
- needs to support
  - g.confs
  - g.divs
  - g.numGamesPlayoffSeries
  - team info (name, region, abbrev, cid, did, etc.)
- implementation ideas
  - g.whatever = [{until: 2015, value: 5}, {until: Infinity, value: 10}]; - with helper functions for getting and setting
    - if during or after playoffs, use next season for "until" valueChange
      - warning in UI that changes won't be applied until next season
    - add extra parameter to g.get to get the value that was active for a given season
    - store cid/did for teams in teamSeasons. fallback to root team object if not present
      - if a change needs to apply for next year, where to store that info
        - easy - make up something like t.pendingChanges
        - better - store as a triggered event in some way that generically supports changing any setting
    - is just the year sufficient for until? needs to be clever... like updating playoffs or confs/divs can't happen during playoffs, and after playoffs it can't happen unless pending team cid/did changes are somehow stored for team objects next year
      - what if these changes are restricted to preseason only?
        - real expansion drafts were held before the actual draft. that would be cool, would just need a way to store pending changes in team cid/did
          - store pending in something like t.pendingChanges, and store actual cid/did in teamSeason
    - build it into g.get (pass season as second arg), and some other helper for writing
  - put in another object store, index by year. that way don't need to store the whole history of all settings in memory forever
    - is that a big enough win to justify a schema change?
- for team name/region/abbrev/imgURL, will need to avoid using caches for that info

legends mode
- start with top 12 players from each franchise's history, in their peak season. incoming draft classes are other real players, randomly selected
- NBA seasons only

dynamic confs/divs
- only allow in certain phase of offseason
- drag and drop ui
- make generic enough that it could be reused for creating new league with custom set of teams

play style changes https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_poss.html
- pace
- 3 point tendency
- 3 point accuracy
- 2 point accuracy
- offensive rebounding

expansion draft
- only allow in certain phase of offseason
  - DRAFT_LOTTERY - definitely, most realistic, but need to do something about lottery results
  - DRAFT, FREE_AGENCY, PREASEASON - could support, but would it be better to force it before the draft always?
- allow division/conference realignment when setting up?
- pick protections
- multiple expansion teams
- allow user to take control of expansion team

add relocation
- team name, abbrev, and region not static
- confs divs not static either
- other things in team or game attributes?

player stats popover
- stats relative to league average
- ovr/pot graph over time
  - put this on player page too
  - https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/g4m90u/suggestion_player_progression_graphs/

redo mood system
- make available throughout the year
  - have deterministic noise, so it can be recomputed constantly as the situation changes
- make it impossible to refuse to re-sign to title winner (really)
- loyalty (both towards this player, and towards other players... like re-signing your guys makes other players think you're loyal)
- make rookies always willing to re-sign (like restricted free agency, kind of)

fewer finals MVPs on losing team

fuzz doesn't really make sense
- have it decrease as a player plays. so high only for draft prospects or unknowns

add copy league function
- https://old.reddit.com/message/messages/nmnr87

better trade finder AI
- handle salary matching constraint
- use in trading block, and betweenAiTeams
- after doing this
  - make sure big trades happen enough in betweenAiTeams - see random.choice weights in betweenAiTeams
  - also make sure betweenAiTeams doens't accept really bad trades, see dv2 check
    - especially for minor trades, not sure if dv as an absolute value rather than % makes sense

global key info (salary, days until playoffs, team  etc)
- league info: days until playoffs, standings/series
- finance info: salary, relative to cap and luxury tax. expiring contracts
- team info: needs (like... rebounding, perimeter defense, shooting, etc)
- ronen

even log revamp
- store info about trade, so the summary of a trade can be linked to
- store the "value" of an event, so it can be used as a filter for important news
- for traded picks, store info so eventual picked players can be filled in later

gm history page
- like team history, but for the teams you GMed
- allow switching after season without getting fired

- per season and career, like in basketball reference
- link to box score
- summary per team at bottom
- somehow show in stats page
- store in normal player stats object (like Lng in football)

average roster age implemented as team advanced stat?

page showing scores by day

jersey numbers
- store in player stats
- viewable in bios
- draw from some known distribution
  - by position, for football
- frivolity like colleges/countries to view
- frivolity for retired jersey numbers?
- collisions
  - if one player is much better than the other (probably based on career stats), they keep the number

pages for each playoff series https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/4qjahi/minor_suggestion_generate_separate_pages_for_each/

OL weight

get rid of basketball/football split, move into one folder structure

login issues
- DefinitelyNotDonaldTrump on discord can help debug
  - from his debugging so far, the response from login.php is correct and the redirect to the account page happens, but local.username is still ""
    - is it not working correctly, setting through localActions?
    - or is it being overridden somewhere, like due to cross tab communication or the worker?
  - also says it happens on both BBGM and FBGM, and that it happens regardless of how many windows are open
  - console.log(document.cookie) - he says this returns an empty string, so i guess the cookie isn't being set somehow
    - would explain things, if cookie was not being set somehow. but should also be checked on account.basketball-gm.com directly

way to save/load leagues on server
- generate GUID per league
- on load, check server for stored leagues for user
- if timestamp is more recent on server, show notification that league is stale and update button
- way to load leagues from server if they are not local already
- some limit on size
- gold only?
- store on my system (s3 maybe) or use google drive?

show winning percentage next to record in team history page

add toggle to table, to turn it into a heatmap showing which values are high or low. like think on a player stats table

end of game playing time situations @gmgameschris

make the 3 year delayed effect of team finances more obvious

teams play better/worse when down/up
- 10 point gap equals home court advantage
  - implementing exactly this would require letting player composite ratings change every possession... maybe too complicated
- @nicidob
- reference http://apbr.org/metrics/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=8501&start=0 in comment

make countries easier to customize
- allow specifying country frequencies without tying it to the number of names
- GUI to add countries and names
- same for colleges

player page UI improvements https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/fbja8g/more_ideas/
- deltas for ratings at the top
- highlight ratings based on comparison to position average (maybe like popover)

more dynamic contracts, based on available cap space
- things this would enable
  - sliders to control talent levels
  - @nicidob Add an option to float the salary cap. Have it come from something like Sum(hype * population). So if NY/LA/CHI/MXC have bad teams, it's worse! Maybe even have hype depend on team rating (so if the whole league is playing crappy teams then the cap goes down).

if earned achievement but blocked due to god mode in past or easy difficulty, still send notification explaining that

less fatigue in playoffs
- benchmark playoff performance (seed upsets)

error if cid/did mismatch on imported team

- later
  - show record and ovr in box score too
  - show player with highest game score under completed game

teamRegion in playersPlus needed?

sw cache issue
- might have been due to index.html being cached by cloudflare. that's disabled now (feb 8). it things don't improve, add logging in sw.js to send version to index.html, and then attach that to error log in bugsnag
- could also store quota amount in log
- looks like it could be old sw staying active somehow
- try to reproduce on low disk space

nicidob - Something like "Team Hall of Fame" based on wins/MOV/playoff. And some way to see in-season MOV graphs, and multi-season MOV/Win%/PowerRanking

Jofish - when you make a move that causes an error in your roster (i.e. not enough/too many players) and try to simulate the all-star game, it freezes. I understand that the game still has to check if the rosters are proper, however, there is no warning given. Even though it doesn't make sense that the user's roster has to comply within the league even though it's the all-star game, a simple warning given would be nice

turnover in 2 point conversion -> wrong team still kicking off, wtf

typescript
- to do
  - types for toWorker
    - flatten into a single object, rather than having "type". this will make typing the inputs and outputs easier
    - test with tradeCounterOffer
    - see OfferType
    - if it's possible to make it work with no explicit array passed for optional args, do same in toUI
  - backboard -> idb
    - my branch has two fixes:
      - https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb/pull/151
      - https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb/issues/152
  - any -> unknown
    - also in dependencies, like bbgm-router
  - @ts-ignore still needed? maybe write script to check
- later
  - playersPlus
    - finish teamsPlus first, it's easier!
    - probably not worth attempting until there is a better way to share code. like anything in overrides is a problem cause it's not statically analyzable, including STATS_TABLES

unify "More" links

switch Dropdown to DropdownLinks rather than Select?
- see how react-dropdown or react-select deal with tons of options
  - what about on mobile?
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40692950/how-to-make-long-bootstrap-dropdown-menus-vertically-scrollable

I should add easter eggs so that real historical figures sometimes appear in the game if you're simulating at that time. How dope would it be if you're simulating the 12th century and Genghis Khan shows up in the draft

- userTid always at top!

in football, sometimes pot is less than ovr, why?

kicker trade value

god mode options for tendencies
- sport specific options, like shot tendencies, enabling/disabling 3 pointers, etc
- have them as sliders, where 50 means "no effect", 0 means "never happens", and 100 means "always". then blend those rates with the default rates behind the scenes
- maybe redo foulRateFactor this way

illness @mattable#4273
- pass to teammates or opponents
- list of diseases, each with a different average length and probability to spread
- if can be fatal, make sure to always create new FAs
  - playoffs?

add more variance in player development with some kind of professionalism/ambition rating https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/e15yuv/unpredictability_of_progression_and_the_football/

team rating
- currently for past seasons, includes traded players on both teams. so intead, store value at end of each season
  - stored value will also make power rankings simpler and faster
- show on other pages, like team history
- team potential rating?
- somehow show everywhere, like how RatingsStatsPopover is for players
- change scale, make it harder to get 100?
  - but also don't make there be no variation in default leagues. maybe make it nonlinear 90+

god mode options
- population growth
- salary cap growth
- inflation of other revenue/expenses
- make them constant, or from a random distribution?

bundle size by removing dependency (tested by adding to "external" in rollup config)
- lodash total - ~18kb in worker and ui, and basically all of that is shared so there's only benefit in replacing it all

keep box scores with feats, and ASG

SW stuff
- dynamic rather than precache like https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/proxx/blob/master/src/sw/index.ts maybe

hype revamp
- make more transparent
- YWT

button to randomize ratings on customize player screen

zipped files @Jofish#5051
- https://github.com/Stuk/jszip is a bit big
- https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1228989899686260736 in Chrome 80

dashboard ui
- make "new league" button integrated on table - fixed top row maybe, with "new league" replacing "play"?
- team logos

DataTable
- places to use sortValue (implemented) and searchValue (not implemented yet):
  - any place with sortValue probably needs searchValue too
  - Height/Weight in PlayerBios needs searchValue
  - DraftAbbrev
  - NegotiateButtons (search for negotiate/refuses)
  - sorting by skills on draft history
  - Dashboard -> Ago (needs different search and sort values!)
  - would allow sorting by checked/unchecked for trade and trading block
  - get rid of awkward children stuff - PlayerNameLabels, mood, ...
  - then get rid of react-addons-text-content
  - PlayerName and PlayerTeam in AllStarHistory

https://react-hook-form.com/ for forms

more customize player options
- fixed position
- hof
- awards

Could you add a page which shows all the game results on any given day? Just the scores would be cool, maybe the top performer (best gamescore player, but show their pts/reb/ast) too, but mainly just a way to see what happened in every game that day without jumping around game logs.

load file from url https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/c54rov/automatic_nba_rosters_by_understanding/es28wcf/?context=3
- explanation text?
- docs
  - The tricky part is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS which generally prevents websites from loading data from other domains, for security reasons. As described at that link in excruciating detail, you can allow a file to be included in another domain (or any domain) with the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header. If you don't control your server, that's not very helpful. But I have noticed that GitHub does this automatically on githubusercontent.com, so if you make a GitHub repo, you can use a link like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user_name/repo_name/branch_name/file.json
- https://uppy.io/
  - file sharing platforms are sources, but not destinations?
  - requires server side integration

  - https://github.com/localForage/localForage/blob/master/src/drivers/localstorage.js handles everything i think, but forces it to be async and bring in other stuff
- safe-localstorage - weird fallback API
- local-storage-fallback - only tests errors at initial usage, not subsequent

blocked fg too uncommon?

Just started playing the other day and it's pretty fun! A lot different than BBGM but the roster management is fun even if the games can feel kind of random. Few things stood out. Not sure if this is just for balance purposes, but teams are WAY stricter about giving up next year's 1st round picks than in real life. I can package 3 amazing players and the best I get offered is a 1st 4 years in the future. Meanwhile IRL 1st rounders get traded for much less (Cooper for a 1st straight up).

Also I wonder if there is a way to present a player's value in regards to the position they play. What I mean is if I want to draft a good RB in the game I have to invest an early pick, but in the NFL teams find starting RBs day 3 on a pretty regular basis (although the argument there is OL is more important for the run game than the RB) so that might actually be pretty complicated to implement.

Finally I saw dumbmatter mention this in the initial post, but there really should be guaranteed rookie contracts. They are basically standard in the NFL and I don't see why a simulation wouldn't mirror this. Just feels weird all my players only want 2 year contracts when they are usually stuck with the team for 4 years at least. Just some initial thoughts, great work overall!

keyStats for OL should not show tiny # of tackles

Great players retire too early

rookie contracts too high still?

situationally aware play calling
- pass or run, hurry up or milk the clock with lead
- kneeling to run out clock
- clocking ball to stop clock
- hail mary as a separate play type?
  - needTouchdown

if paying a lot to a QB already, don't sign another expensive one

Also I just had my rookie QB get onto the All-Rookie Team in the QB slot, but he was also slotted in as an All-Rookie punter, without having done any punts all season.

stat distribution pages

too many players playing both offense and defense
- reassess after making roster construction better. if it's still a problem, only allow starter at one position
- too many fat guys with elite speed, small guys with elite strength?

weight formula is not very good

confirm subscription works from football-gm.com
- Basketball GM Gold -> GM Gold, BBGM Commissioner -> The Commissioner in bbgm-account

injury later
- slowly ramp endurance up after injury
  - really, the injury should just impact endurance and odds of reinjury. if you want to force someone to play through an injury, go for it
- injury history leads to chance of reinjury
- height influences injury probability (see same paper as age)

    - clock management, strategy
  - for 2 point conversions and extra points, penalties don't actually move scrimmage currently!
  - log clutch plays
  - blocked fg
    - count as missed field goal
    - chance for either team to return (very slim for offense)
  - blocked punt
  - missed fg/xp return

league leaders recorded in awards
- see leagueLeaders call in doAwards, needs categories

AV advanced stat
- use in value?
- OL and defense
  - need all pro modifier - but this is circular reasoning, since that comes from AV!
  - in individualPts, check if they actually seem to apply (no substantial rushing/receiving/passing stats)

what's the end state here? options:
- everything is in deion, and process.env.SPORT governs the output
  - that'd be nice, but probably unrealistic
- define minimal set of things that need to be overridden, and pass to deion like new DeionUI({...}) - probably this one!!!!!!!
  - e.g. views.. put routes.js and views/index.js in deion. but views/index.js will only have common ones. for others, pass into DeionUI, and reference both sets of views in genPage in routes.js
  - do this, but try to also do the process.env.SPORT solution when possible
- deion remains a set of functions/classes/modules, to be pulled in externally piecemeal. if something internal needs to be overriden, make it generic or a factory or DI or have it accept a parameter to allow overriding

injuries
- make more representative of football: https://footballplayershealth.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/06_Ch2_Injuries.pdf

how to get types working, options:
- make anything depending on an override or sport-sepcific type into a factory function or generic, initialized in deionWorker or deionUI and then passed around
- pass around overrides manually everywhere, not making it a module
- move everything inside deion

how will deionUI(overrides) work with types?
- can pass them as generics, then apply them to factory functions
- Import modules from deion. Add things like extra views. Apply factories/generics.

type better
- skills/compositeRatings - should be RatingsKey, not string for components. And PlayerRatings
- PlayerStatType should be sport specific
- getCopy/getCopies and Cache
  - awards should return Awards
  - players and playersPlus - Player<> and Player<MinimalPlayerRatings> should be Player<PlayerRatings>
- most MinimalPlayerRatings uses should be generic and take PlayerRatings

split more from deion
- processInputs for views only in one sport (depth, shot locations)
- worker API functions only in one sport (depth)

yarn workspaces
- see branch football-yarn-workspaces - all works except karma

show game stats in player page

contract demands and position assignments should be based on which position maximizes p.value, not which position maximizes ovr. would you rather have an 80 ovr qb or a 100 ovr kicker?

RatingsOverview - could put in deion, with config to specify categories and names from getCols
- RatingsForm has this already! re-use

open dashboard, open league in new tab, now shell on dashboard is as if in league
- happens because there is no way to distinguish "local.updateGameAttributes called to initialize new league that the user clicked from the dashboard in this tab" and "local.updateGameAttributes called from another tab, but this tab has lid === undefined so we'll leave it in that state"

login -> account -> doesn't say logged in, sometimes? but account shows in navbar
- happens if you log in in one tab while having another open, then in the 2nd tab go to achievements
  - only in firefox?
  - no, user says chrome too

service worker - workbox
- more explicit upgrades https://deanhume.com/displaying-a-new-version-available-progressive-web-app/
  - workbox-window

https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/

after preseason, after player development, recalculate player value
- use ovr vs PER formula, but with offset based on prior value

Don't allow play if versions in tabs don't match
- close worker?

---

React.StrictMode
- react-sortable-hoc findDOMNode
  - switch to react-movable works, except in Safari https://github.com/tajo/react-movable/issues/30
- reactstrap findDOMNode

to send notification to correct screen, need `conditions` in views/allStars (and other getOrCreate calls). should be possible right? yeah, could request hostID from shared worker, and then sent it to runBefore functions, but... is it worth it? maybe not

BoxScoreRow
- link to team should be for the season of the ASG, not current season always (in boxScore.season but not passed to Row)
- highlight user team abbrev

fix contracts old players too cheap

Difficulty fudge factor should only be for user team (finances, trades)
- for trades this is hard because valueChange does not know if it's the user's team or not, need to accept another parameter

re-evaluate contracts
- somehow market based

make AI smarter about contracts
- then do cool shit, like a tunable "randomness" factor or something that lets you tune player development, and also overall talent level, and also distribution of different ratings (to sim different eras)

ui/api/setGameAttributes logic should be in worker, not ui. minimize transfer

somewhere, show average age of team

increase PG cutoff
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8lfyuh/7_center_turns_into_pg_when_the_season_starts/

option to edit AI trade rate https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8kqzl9/trade_frequency/

index updating
- currenty: check if the indexed property has changed, and only update a specific index then
- would be better: make _dirtyIndexes per index, not per store  
- even better: incrementally update index

later
- in new league: set rookie contracts appropriately
- in new league: initialize rebuilding/contending to non-random values
- don't include core.debug in prod builds?
- steeper penalties for unbalanced lineups
  - increasing perimfactor not enough - need to reevaluate formula. see all_bigs.json
    - perimfactor shouldn't be needed. just use the synergy stuff. should be offense and defense. check values for normal and extreme teams
- simulate draft from past seasons, to correctly assign contracts (don't need to populate actual draft info)

NEED TO FIX TRADE AI
- make tests of trades that should/shouldn't happen
- example: should never offer a strictly worse pick for a better pick. or at least not commonly

no POT mode, to make it harder

p.valueWithContract is exactly equal to p.value currently!

team shot locations playoffs
- share code with team stats for highlighting and playoff W/L

persist fantasy draft results
- make an array of draft results
- viewable somehow - need to track when fantasy drafts happened and add them to draft results menu

---

more flexible auto play - shorter period of time, individual phases, etc. would require non-alert dialog

1. If there was a "select all" for not including draft picks in trades. So instead of going down 1 by 1 to check don't include you could just say NO to trading any of your 4,000 picks. 

2. If searching player rating also included contracts. Usually you'll want to find a high potential guy on a cheap contract.

career totals on player pages https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7ya1yu/any_more_thoughts_on_the_beta/duptp08/?context=3

open multiple leagues from dashboard at the same time - Invalid cache status "filling"
- looks like flush is being called while status is "filling", can that be short circuited since idb.cache has been redefined? lid is different, or the hostID is different?
  - happens because it calls "flush" when closing an existing open database. should be more explicit about state of loading (no league loaded or loading, league X loaded and no league loading, league X loaded and league Y loading, no league loaded and league Y loading)
  - then will also need a way to prevent UI errors, if a UI update function is running and expects e.g. g to be populated but it's not - UI should check the aforementioned state as well and wait for loaded

reevaluate FA system - too easy to rebuild
- too many young stars available
- first pick at most players

move react up, before worker is initialized, so compareVersions error can be displayed there

somehow display synergy, maybe on roster page

watch list players should result in notifications when things happen (FA salary drops, trades, signings, release, retire)
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7h3eqy/simple_feature_request/

advanced team stats
- strength of schedule: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index9e6d.html?p=37&cpage=1
  - to set up this system of equations, need to know the schedule, but that is not stored anywhere currently. need to persist original schedule. maybe only soft delete games as they are played, or copy to another table?
  - use https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-solve to solve
- team ortg/drtg/nrtg adjusted for strength of schedule

- https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html
- http://www.apbr.org/metrics/viewtopic.php?p=35755#p35755

advanced stat table too confusing? needs vertical dividers/spacing?

use something besides PER in player value formula

new adv stats in roster page?
- switch PER to WS/48 - roster.js now pulling both, then eventually switch Roster.js
- same for HoF
- OR, wait for BPM?

customizable columns in datatable
- get rid of supercols where possible, like bbr
- for supercols, instead of colspan, pass a list of column names (need to get rid of repeats like raw % first)
  - won't work when there are duplicates. instead needs to be a hierarchy. maybe just pass hierarchy with names, and do getCols in DataTable? but then how to pass extra props like width, is that really needed?
    - search through, find any weird ones, try to eliminate:
      - Draft - setting width, and splicing for fantasy draft
      - PowerRankings - setting width
      - TeamFinances - dynamically use years
      - TeamRecords - some overrides
      - Trade, TradingBlock - override for "" column
  - crazy idea: pass cols only as keys in data (change array -> object), and for supercols prefix like SuperCol|Col
  - or in cols array, add prop to denote supercols
- pass additional parameter containing which columns are visible, by name (if none, then assume all)
- get rid of search
- sortBy by name, not index
- button to reset datatable
- store all datatable params in one localstorage object
- always return all stats and ratings?

some way to see draft picks by team, now that there are AI trades

AI trades
- notification? only for big trades. quantify! maybe show that info in transactions page too

AI propose trade to user
- need way to show popup with link to trade page

colors
- color ratings on ratings page (and tables), just like ratings popup
- color stats in ratings popover

force single tab per league
- when < 5 seconds, wait for another heartbeat before deciding
- check for collission in setInterval, and somehow show error page if that happens

shared worker
- namespace stuff, after it's working for one league
  - attach lid to promiseWorker instance in host (call it "metadata"), update lid if it changes, and attach to every request from host
    - then from worker, pass into toUI
  - query API: flag to determine if broadcast or single response. default single response. optional last arg, so single response use case is same API as now
    - if broadcast, then response is always undefined
    - broadcast needs to be namespaced, too. like only "update all league 5" not "update all tabs open in every league"
      - figure out some way to abstract... like maybe a conditional broadcast function defined based on metadata
  - namespace leagues (or force only one league)
    - namespace locks, g (in worker only), idb.league, and idb.cache
    - all common functions, accept g as param
    - something to handle init/close of tabs
    - look at all toUI calls
  - disconnect league when none are left registered to promise worker (so need api to get all metadata)

when dirty on close, show warning window, and initiate flush (if not already in progress)
- hard to coordinate across UI and worker...

better loading screen, after React takes control but before initial page is rendered - because it can be slow for loading a league

  http://railsware.com/blog/2017/01/10/mocking-es6-module-import-without-dependency-injection/

get tests working
- db.getCopy.teams
  - operate on individual functions? can export them just for tests
  - confirm operations that don't require IDB
  - confirm getAll updates from cache

refactor
- clear, delete need to handle indexes

document cache data format and API!
- different things are cached, depending on object store
- all modifications go into cache
- cache mutations are dangerous, see getCopy
- read from just the cache if you're sure everything is there (like an active player). otherwise, read from db and augment with cache (because anything could be in cache, even if it's not normally.. like retired player added to watch list). getCopy variables do this
- promise microtask worker crap - for firefox support, if you start a backboard tx manually, you can't do any promise/asyncawait stuff inside the callback

event log refactor
- react
- keep state just on worker
- "event log" page with ALL events, should be impossible to "miss" an event

----

- possession length
  - ? timeouts to advance ball (shorter possession) or make subs
  - ? shot clock violation

  bump up penalties for unbalanced teams

    rewrite gamesim, fixing all these problems? also, coaching less agressively when game is blowout, playing stars more in important games, ...
    tricky: good teams have high skill players, who are going to do really well in any synergy metric. so it's hard to punish unbalanced teams through synergy without decreasing parity by a lot
      hacky approach: stay with something similar to current system, but with an extra penalty for very unbalanced teams (could be sigmoidal so it only affects really poorly balanced teams)
    probably will need to increase synergyFactor
    might need to tweak some probabilities if this changes stats too much

PLAYER DEVELOPMENT REVAMP
-------------------------

shouldn't have literally every aging player turn into a great shooter

old players are currently undervalued

http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/255sta/i_think_we_need_longer_dynasty_achievements/che050a?context=3
IMPORTANT http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/20i6v3/still_too_easy_to_trade_for_drafted_players/
  just drafted players are undervalued, possibly related to the following issue
second round draft picks are undervalued. also, giving away a pick should never make a trade worse, but sometimes it does now. http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2bg3zx/simple_feature_mark_players_as_offlimits_when_we/cj5ap89
  similarly, trading block for nothing can net you second round picks
trade for tons of cheap second round picks, then use that to trade for good asset: www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/27wjnp/33_pennies_for_a_dollar/
release and resign pick exploit http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zn61h/finances/cfvzr35\
some limit on trades so people can't make 1000 slightly beneficial trades: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zzwbs/suggestions_on_trades/cg0e0dg
  probably make opposing owners less likely to trade as the number of proposed trades increases in a season
Eventually:
  "What would make this work?" functions should know about contending/rebuilding. Contending teams should be more eager to offer up young/cheap players, rebuilding teams should be more eager to offer up old/expensive players
    basically, they should view the trade from the other team's perspective, not just their own
  Can I provide better feedback about trade? Like if it's close or not? Or if it's rejected because of cap space issues?
  Set params with optimization algorithm
  Fix needToDrop stuff
    Problem now is, contract gets pushed into someone on the roster and it's lost. This is especially obvious if there is only one player in add and his contract is pushed to roster, then the trade is nothing.
    Probably not that important, since teams almost always have shitty players at the end of their rosters
  EXPLOIT that might be tricky to solve: in the "resigning players" phase, your free agents should still count towards your cap. Otherwise, you can trade to take on salary and then sign your players over the cap
  Should draft pick contract "worth" be determined better somehow, like it is for normal contracts? probably yes
    does this allow removal of fudge factor?
  population (i.e. richness) should influence opinion of contracts

    tweak perimFactor and synergyFactor.
  increase turnovers, particularly if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  increase fouls if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  assists should be function of speed, since those players have the ball more
  situational awareness http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1yg6wi/end_of_game_simulation/
  mediocre players on bad teams should be less efficient (shouldn't put up such a high PER, which falls if they join a good team)
add free agent to the end of roster
mode with ratings hidden
  implement like fuzz?
  maybe use very rough letter grades like A/B/C/D/F to replace the ratings
"My Player" mode http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2swmwj/there_should_be_a_game_like_myplayer_in_2k/cntkvj4

MINOR FIXES
-----------

documentation
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2agxoe/questions_and_suggestions_from_a_new_player/
Add MVP and Titles columns to HoF table
Make good young players much less likely to become FAs
don't need to store abbrev with awards, just tids
  fix display in season summary (correct in historyAll)
show team records in playoffs page
on team history, show counts of conf/league championships, hall of fame players, etc
if a player refuses to resign, that decision should also be reflected in free agency (don't recalculate mood)
add "drb" to usage so that good ball handlers shoot more (favor guards over bigs more)
in player page, show red/green for ratings changes from the previous year, maybe as heatmap
in ratings tables, show dpot and dovr columns? maybe?
Add markers for clinching playoffs / 1st seed in league standings
league leaders glitch http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1r20x5/league_leaders_bug/
merge game.play and freeAgents.play
replace random.gauss with random.realGauss
don't need to check every team's roster limits every time games are played - could auto keep AI teams in line after any trade (with user or between AI teams), and then only the user's team needs to be checked
UI to easily switch between conference and division standings on small screens and dashboard http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2d4o9r/feature_requests_of_the_week_august_10_2014/cjqrwtf?context=3
schedule page (and dashboard and maybe gamelog) should show opponent records
add "play until end of quarter" in live gamesim

LOW PRIORITY
------------

track longest W/L streaks
tooling
  istanbul https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage
team chemistry http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2oco2a/simple_suggestion_team_chemistry/cmrpap6?context=3
use compound index on season + team for games obectStore in helpers.gameLogList, views.leagueDashboard, maybe elsewhere
upcoming free agents page should show at least some information about signings (or non-signings) during re-sign phase
box plots / distributions
  "it'd be great to overlay your roster to see where you stand. Maybe click on a name in a list to add or remove it from the display. Do I have a fast team? Do I have a three point shooting team? Are we big and bruising and slow?"

compare players http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1saclf/suggestion_compare_players/
awards
  show awards count in hall of fame
add numbers for players
  ability to retire numbers
fantasy draft
  when fantasy draft is over, go to summary of the draft
    do this in core.draft.untilUserOrEnd
  add entry for fantasy draft summary to draft history dropdown?
league settings
  enable/disable trading rules
cross-league play
mobile UI, bootstrap 3
  do something about hover tooltips
    injury
    skills
      for injury and skills, maybe make the whole block a hyperlink that opens a popover
        make sure to use on player page too.. can i use helpers.playerName.. there too?
    table headers
    others?
some kind of playoff series overview page, including box scores for easy access
luxury tax money should be redistributed to non-taxpaying teams (or teams under the cap?)
A year-to-date comparison of team finances with the previous year.
more detailed player moods - http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1k4val/players_refusing_to_sign_bug/cbln1oo?context=3
  player personality, team chemistry
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1tkw3e/idea_player_traits/
dashboard info should be on a widget accessible from any screen
player search page
  show stats, ratings, contract, etc. (customizable); allow filters to be applied. also filter by skill icon
  search by stats, ratings, or attributes
  trade for button, or sign button if free agent, or draft button if draft prospect
    same contextual buttons for watch list
    can this become main UI for drafting (at least fantasy draft)
finances
  too easy to make big $$$
    owner should take profits each year
  AI teams should adjust spending
player morale - punishment for tanking
harsher, more realistic luxury tax
midlevel exception
more refined control of playing time
  http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbaegpq
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1qaml8/playing_time_explain_to_me_like_im_8/
  just set minutes directly? any minutes not included, leave up to coach's discretion
draft
  randomness in picks should factor in relative ratings http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1l1713/the_draft_still_needs_some_work_it_seems_my/cbutw7v?context=1
trades between AI teams
  each day, pick two random teams. if a trade can be found that both teams like, do it
    generalize core.trade.makeItWork and other parts of core.trade
  transaction log is necessary to keep tabs on this stuff
  also propose trades to the user, somehow
core.team.valueChange should be used to pick which free agents to sign in core.freeAgents.autoSign, but that would be a bitch beacuse of how transactions are set up
  also for resigning players in core.season
trades
  cash
    estimate value of cash - different for different teams? depending on cash, net profit recently, and market size
    upper limit? what is NBA rule?
  more feedback from AI
    if trade is close/far from working, return different messages
    display some indication of what a team wants to do on the trade view, e.g.
      "I need to cut my payroll and start making more money."
      "I could really use a good rebounder."
  sign and trade (only during resigning phase)
god mode
  options
    disable ratings display
  edit other player attributes (draft, etc)
export/import roster
  some way to specify startingSeason
  easily edit in excel?
increase hype for big free agent signings
how to handle aggregating stats for players who played for more than one team in a season? add them all up in ps in db.getPlayers
  for roster, want just a player's stats with this team this season
    this currently works, just pass a tid
  for player stats view, want total among all teams for one season
    no pass tid and you only get the latest row. need added logic to do sum
  for player view, want separate and combined rows in careerStats without fucking up totals (including PER)
    no pass tid and you get each team separately, but no merged stats as above
contracts
  maybe make them nonlinear.. role players lower, stars higher
    compare to NBA contract distribution
if fouling out drops team below 5 active players, play fouled out players but add a FT each foul (technical)
show old contracts on old roster view
core.trade refactoring
  validateSavedTids crap should be in trade.js.
  trade.summary stuff should be automatic and stored in tradeStore
  trade and clear buttons should be disabled during gameSim, with message like in team finances
final score, hall of fame
  influenced by size of city (see: difficulty in views.newLeague)
AI modules that contain functions which are called to determine actions
  things to regulate...
    draft picks
    signing free agents
    resigning players
    trades
    budget items (like from team finances view)
    releasing/buying out players when over limit
AI teams should periodically reorder rosters throughout the season
some UI showing the state of the team's synergy. maybe like an advisors screen that suggests what kind of player is needed to improve synergy
  also can respond to budget changes
  more general: have "media" reporting things like 10 worst contracts, etc
like on team finances page, anywhere else to add help popups?
  should this be abstracted rather than just inline in views?
  inline anything from the manual?
freeAgentMoods should affect AI team signings - or should it?
  for resigning players
  for signing free agents
AI updating of *Budgets and ticket prices
  maybe not necessary at this stage?
  call core.finances.updateBudgetRanks() after
update formulas
  nationalTvRevenue
    same for each team, change contract year by year and display in team finances
  localTvRevenue
    eventually, t.seasons[0].tvContract

FUTURE
------

event log UI
  allow filtering type with checkboxes
  what about events with no tid? they are currently not viewable
shot charts showing hot spots (red/yellow/green) based on shot location data
If you are simulating through the whole season and execute a trade while simulating, it will continue simulating even if you are over the roster limit. http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1xch01/trades_after_season/cfamo73
hire/fire different coaches with different strategies
boxplots for shot location stats, plus comparison to NBA data
import/export stuff
  online "locker" that you can sync saved games to
  league names
    "Edit" button between "Export" and "Delete" - set in leaguesStore and gameAttributes
      move delete/edit/export under one button, "manage". have the 3 buttons pop out in place when you hit manage, then it functions as it does now. popped buttons can be colored too, then
moving to other cities
expansion teams (add population growth, expand when certain conditions are met)
team finances view
  compare bar graphs against league averages?
different size stadiums, building new stadiums
tv revenue as a variable
  local tv contract - $10 million
    base on tvContractAmount, tvContractExp
    will be a deal from 3 to 5 years in length
    based on...
      region population
      "hype"
      random noise
      "random event" - competition between two networks, Sports TV and The Basketball Channel
    when renegotiating and really bad, the guy pretends not to know you - "Atlanta Herons? Is that the team from the Mexican/Canadian/Arena/Indoor/Xtreme Volleyball/Soccer/Tennis/Racing/Curling/MudWrestling League?"
input to helpers.formatCurrency (and all currency in variables everywhere) should be in 1000s of dollars and then only converted to millions when displayed
AI teams should have to deal with fuzz too
views.teamFinances should merge db call with team.filter to get seasonAttrs, but that will require rewriting seasonAttrs handling in team.filter to handle multiple seasons.
live play-by-play simulation
  slow it down http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1pu92x/new_feature_live_playbyplay_simulation/cd6xq54?context=3
  change of possession with no rebound/turnover?
  could fake where the shots are to display graphically
  allow the user to make substitutions in realtime
multi team trades
